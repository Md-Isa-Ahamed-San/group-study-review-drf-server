âœ… What happened:

- Global `pip` was broken, but you correctly **activated your venv (`venv-drf`)** and upgraded pip inside it.
- Now `pip` works fine in the virtual environment, and all your Django-related dependencies installed successfully.

Your setup is now clean and isolated â€” you can start your Django project without worrying about the corrupted global Python install.
WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO RUN THE PROJECT FIRST TIME YOU HAVE TO CREATE THE VIRTUAL ENV OF PYTHON. RUN THIS COMMAND

```powershell

python -m venv ./venv-drf

```

ðŸ‘‰ From here on, just make sure you **always activate the venv** before running Django commands:

```powershell

.\venv-drf\Scripts\activate

```

Then run things like:

```powershell

django-admin startproject myproject .
python manage.py runserver


```

Would you like me to also give you a **minimal Django REST Framework starter project structure** (with `urls.py`, `views.py`, and a sample API endpoint) so you can test everything quickly?
